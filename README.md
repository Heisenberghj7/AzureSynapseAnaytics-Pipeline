**`Project Title:`**

- Secure Data Pipeline from Azure SQL to Azure Synapse Analytics with Power BI Dashboard

**`Project Description:`**

- This GitHub repository documents a secure and efficient data pipeline solution designed and implemented as a freelance project for VisualDispatch, a prominent American logistics company. The primary objective was to develop a robust pipeline that transforms data seamlessly from Azure SQL to Azure Synapse Analytics while ensuring the highest standards of security and data integrity.

**`Key Features:`**

- Data Transformation: The pipeline automates the data transformation process, ensuring data consistency and accuracy.

- Statistics Generation: It includes scripts for running statistics on the transformed data, providing valuable insights for business decision-making.

- Power BI Integration: A Power BI dashboard is integrated into the pipeline, offering visually compelling data visualization for users.

- Security: Robust security measures were implemented, including Azure Active Directory roles and permissions, to safeguard sensitive data and control access.

**`Client Engagement:`**
- The project was executed remotely through TeamViewer, allowing real-time collaboration with VisualDispatch's CEO. Detailed explanations and training were provided to ensure the VisualDispatch team could use and maintain the solution independently in the future.

**`Client Engagement:`**

- A well-documented data pipeline architecture.
- Code and scripts for data transformation and statistics generation.
- Integration of a Power BI dashboard for data visualization.
- Secure role-based access control using Azure Active Directory.
